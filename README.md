# About The Project

<br />

**TOGLOW** A professional contribution platform that allows women to showcase their achievements in a transparent and decentralized manner while receiving tokens for their contributions. It introduces the first tool aimed at shifting the paradigm in how we understand work, promoting equity and access to global opportunities, thus impacting the digital divide.

# The Problem TOGLOW Solves

With the TOGLOW platform, we reduce the gender gap that currently exists in Latin America by introducing a new work model that aligns with the demand in digital media and benefits people who work remotely on projects of any kind

**TOGLOW** Focused Solutions:

Elimination of Bias: By using blockchain, contributions are recorded immutably, returning the value of the contribution to the individual.
Global Opportunity Gateway: The platform acts as a gateway, highlighting individual contributions and connecting them with collaboration opportunities worldwide.
Focus on Contributions, Not Titles: Similar to GitHub, where skills are demonstrated through collaboration and code, this platform allows women to shine through their contributions to projects, not just by their titles.

# Challenges We Ran Into

Our main challenge was designing the product in a way that it functions as a massive search engine for contributions and contributors within a single network. We had to find two developers to join the team on a tight schedule to make this possible. The platform needed to be both persuasive and easy to use.
