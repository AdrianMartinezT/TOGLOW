# About The Project

<br />

**TOGLOW** A professional contribution platform that allows women to showcase their achievements in a transparent and decentralized manner while receiving tokens for their contributions. It introduces the first tool aimed at shifting the paradigm in how we understand work, promoting equity and access to global opportunities, thus impacting the digital divide.

# The Problem TOGLOW Solves

With the TOGLOW platform, we reduce the gender gap that currently exists in Latin America by introducing a new work model that aligns with the demand in digital media and benefits people who work remotely on projects of any kind

**Supply Cycle** eliminates every uncertainty around these transactions by making them 100% transparent and traceable for both our donors and beneficiaries through smart contracts, attestations, and a mechanism to reward actors in the ecosystem that collaborate efficiently, enhancing our reputation system.

Companies will also benefit from this service in different areas at any time.

# Challenges We Ran Into

The main challenge we faced was to successfully activate our smart contracts while including attestations and developing live delivery tracking through QR codes for every stakeholder involved in the process. Additionally, we aimed to follow a simple user design for our web development that effectively communicates our main product.

# How it Works

Our app starts at the donation center, where goods are received and logged into the blockchain. This ensures that every item is accounted for from the very beginning, providing a transparent record of all donations.
Delivery Bus

As goods are transported, our app tracks their movement in real-time. Delivery personnel can easily update the status of shipments, ensuring that all stakeholders have up-to-date information on the location and condition of the goods.

Distribution Center
Distribution Center

At distribution centers, our app facilitates efficient inventory management and allocation of resources. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of how goods are distributed.
Aid Recipients

Finally, our app tracks the delivery of aid to recipients. This last step completes the chain of custody, providing a full picture of how donations are used and ensuring that they reach those in need.
